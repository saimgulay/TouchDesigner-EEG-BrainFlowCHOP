# Brainflow Script CHOP for TouchDesigner

![BrainFlowCHOP UI](images/BrainFlowCHOP.png)

## Introduction
This project introduces a real-time EEG data processing pipeline integrated within TouchDesigner via a Script CHOP. It leverages the BrainFlow SDK for device communication, and incorporates signal filtering, re-sampling, FFT transformation, and OSC output functionalities. The core motivation is to allow artists, researchers, and real-time system designers to integrate brain-computer interface (BCI) input directly into generative audiovisual environments without relying on external bridging software.

## Installation

1. After downloading this repository to your computer, install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install brainflow scipy python-osc numba
```

Then:

Place the script inside a Script CHOP in TouchDesigner

Enable the script by selecting your board and serial port. 

For fast installation, copy and paste the code inside BrainFlowCHOP.py to callback of a Script CHOP after installing dependencies. 


## Dependencies
```bashbrainflow
scipy
python-osc
numba
```
## Requirements
TouchDesigner (latest build)

BrainFlow-compatible EEG device (tested with BrainBit only)

Python 3 (64-bit, matching TouchDesigner Python environment)

It is strongly recommended to manage Python environments using TouchDesigner’s built-in environment manager:
[**TD Python Environment Manager**](https://derivative.ca/community-post/introducing-touchdesigner-python-environment-manager-tdpyenvmanager/72024)


## Limitations
Only tested on BrainBit (4-channel EEG)

Currently uses CPU-heavy loops for filtering

Does not include visual diagnostics of EEG/FFT signals

## Motivation
TouchDesigner is widely used for real-time visuals and interactive systems. However, native support for EEG integration is limited. This script was developed to bridge that gap, offering a robust, flexible, and extensible framework for bringing real-time biosignals into audiovisual workflows. The implementation also provides an accessible entry point for research-grade EEG integration within live creative environments.

## Justification
Many existing EEG-to-creative-system bridges require multiple applications, extensive configuration, or custom networking stacks. By embedding the entire data acquisition, filtering, and forwarding logic within TouchDesigner, this tool simplifies the development process while remaining highly configurable. This script enables low-latency integration with systems such as Wekinator, Max/MSP, Unreal, and Unity via OSC.

## Prototype Description
This project makes extensive use of the BrainFlow SDK for multi-device EEG data acquisition and control. BrainFlow provides a unified API for interacting with a wide range of biosignal hardware, enabling consistent access to streaming, configuration, and metadata across platforms. For more information, visit https://brainflow.org.

The Script CHOP offers the following key functionalities:

- EEG data acquisition via BrainFlow-compatible devices

- Channel selection and live streaming

- Optional Kalman filtering (fully parameterised)

- Optional FFT transformation

- Custom re-sampling rate

- OSC output of selected time and/or frequency domain data

- Live trash collection and resource maintenance

- Parameter pages include:

- General Settings: Device selection, serial port, re-sampling rate

- Time Settings: Update interval configuration

- Filter Settings: Kalman filter toggle and noise parameters

- FFT Settings: FFT toggle

- OSC Settings: Address, port, OSC message path, and channels to send

## Supported Devices

- STREAMING_BOARD, PLAYBACK_FILE_BOARD, SYNTHETIC_BOARD

The full list is populated dynamically in the UI from the BrainFlow enumeration.




## Tests
The system was tested using a 4-channel BrainBit device over Bluetooth. Functional validation included:

- Successful device connection and data acquisition

- Real-time Kalman filtering with dynamic parameters

- Re-sampling integrity (250Hz target rate)

- FFT accuracy across sample windows

- OSC communication with external software (Wekinator)

- Live parameter updates without requiring script reload

Limitations of testing:

Only one device type (BrainBit) was tested

Limited to four EEG channels

No systematic validation with FFT-based downstream learning models

## Evaluation
The script performs reliably under moderate processing loads and achieves smooth real-time performance on standard consumer hardware (tested on macOS). Kalman filtering significantly improves signal stability. Resampling and FFT functionalities are accurate within numerical precision limits. OSC output is fast and compatible with common UDP-based systems.

However, CPU usage could increase when scaling to high-channel-count devices. The current implementation uses nested loops in Python for Kalman filtering, which may not scale efficiently. FFT results are unnormalised and might require post-processing depending on the target application.

## Future Tests and Design Directions
Extend testing to devices with higher channel counts (e.g., OpenBCI, Muse S, ANT Neuro)

Replace looped Kalman filter with a batched vectorised JIT implementation

Implement OSC bundling for optimised transmission

Add time synchronisation and timestamp output

Improve user interface with device-specific channel labelling

Add support for alternative protocols (e.g., WebSockets or Serial)
